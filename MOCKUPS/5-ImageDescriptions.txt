1-Intro.png
	This is the intro screen for the game.  We will animate it and the user will be asked to press
 a button to start the game.

2-GameStart.png
	This is the screen that will appear after the into window has been closed.  It has 3 rows of 4
 bricks that are blue and will change color when they are hit.  The Score and Lives are displayed in 
the top corner and the paddle and ball are at the bottom.


3-GameInProgress.png
	This is an example of how the game will look when a game is in progress.  The red bricks only
 need to be hit one more time to be destroyed.  The yellow need to be hit two more times, and the blue 
hasn’t been hit yet.


4-GameOver.png
	The game over screen.  This will display when the user runs out of lives.  It will display 
their score.






I don’t think the design will change too much when we implement it.  Colors and UI elements will 
probably change, but the overall flow and look will probably be pretty close to the mockup images.  We
 will need more bricks per the project description however.
